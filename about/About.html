    <img src="simas.jpg" alt="My Photo" width="150">
    <p>Hello! I'm Simas Simokaitis, an aspiring IT professional and data analyst currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at Kennesaw State University. With an expected graduation in May 2026, I'm actively developing my technical skills in JavaScript, Python, SQL, and data analytics tools like Looker Studio.
        Beyond coursework, I serve as a Supplemental Instruction Leader at KSU, where I facilitate structured study sessions to help students grasp complex concepts. My leadership skills extend to my extracurricular activities, including my involvement with KSUâ€™s Club Volleyball team.
        I'm currently seeking an internship or co-op in IT or data analytics to gain hands-on industry experience and refine my technical expertise. My goal is to apply my analytical mindset, problem-solving skills, and teamwork abilities to innovative projects that drive real-world impact.</p>
